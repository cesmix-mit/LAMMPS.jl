The string may have multiple lines (separated by newline characters) and also single commands may be distributed over multiple lines with continuation characters (’&’). Those lines are combined by removing the ‘&’ and the following newline character.

For all other variable types, a copy will be made regardless. The underlying LAMMPS API call for VAR_ATOM internally allways creates a copy of the data. As the memory for this gets allocated by LAMMPS instead of julia, it needs to be dereferenced using LAMMPS.API.lammps_free instead of through the garbage collector.  If copy=false this gets acieved by registering LAMMPS.API.lammps_free as a finalizer for the returned data. Alternatively, setting copy=true will instead create a new copy of the data. The lammps allocated block of memory will then be freed immediately.\n\nthe kwarg group determines for which atoms the variable will be extracted.
